‍Last Update: Monday, June 6th 2024

Introduction

‍

ClientLens is committed to providing a superior learning experience for everyone we work with. We know that our users’ are 
committed to their success and we are equally committed to ensuring that each interaction that someone has with our content 
is optimized for maximum educational potential. To enable us to do this, ClientLens needs to gather and use certain information 
about individuals.

‍

Individuals who we gather information about includes customers, affiliates, business contacts, employees, and other people 
the organization has a relationship with or may need to contact.

This policy describes how this personal data is collected, handled, and stored to meet the company’s data protection 
standards — and to comply with the law.

‍

Why this policy exists

‍

This data protection policy ensures ClientLens:

‍

Complies with data protection law and follows industry best practices

Protects the rights of staff, customers, affiliates, and partners

Is open about how it stores and processes individuals’ data

Protects itself from the risks of a data breach

Eu general data protection regulation (gdpr) protection law

‍

The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) protection law describes how organizations who conduct business with 
individuals or entities located in EU (European Union) nations — including ClientLens — must collect, handle, and store 
personal information.

‍

These rules apply regardless of whether data is stored electronically, on paper, or in any other manner.

‍

To comply with the law, personal information must be collected and used fairly, stored safely, and not disclosed unlawfully.

‍

The EU GDPR is underpinned by eight core principles. These state that personal data must:

Be processed fairly and lawfully
Be obtained only for specific, lawful purposes
Be adequate, relevant, and not excessive
Be accurate and kept up to date
Not be held for any longer than necessary
Processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects
Be protected in appropriate ways
Not be transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA), unless that country or territory also ensures an 
adequate level of protection
‍

1. policy statement

‍

Every day our business will receive, use, and store personal information about our customers, affiliates, partners, 
and colleagues. It is important that this information is handled lawfully and appropriately, in line with the requirements 
of the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation (collectively referred to as the ‘Data Protection 
Requirements’).

‍

We take our data protection duties seriously, because we respect the trust that is being placed in us to use personal information 
appropriately and responsibly.

‍

2. about this policy

‍

This policy and any other documents referred to in it, sets out the basis on which we will process any personal data that we 
collect or process. This policy does not form part of any employee’s contract of employment and may be amended at any time.

‍

The company as a whole is responsible for ensuring compliance with the Data Protection Requirements and with this policy. 
Any questions about the operation of this policy or any concerns that the policy has not been followed should be referred 
in the first instance to the Data Protection Officer.

‍

3. what is personal data?

‍

Personal data is defined as data, (whether stored electronically or paper based) relating to a living individual who can 
be identified directly or indirectly from that data, (or from that data and other information in our possession).

‍

Processing is any activity that involves use of personal data. It includes obtaining, recording, or holding the data, 
organizing, amending, retrieving, using, disclosing, erasing, or destroying it. Processing also includes transferring 
personal data to third parties under privacy control conditions.

‍

Sensitive personal data includes contact info, address, session activity on the platform, IP location etc. Sensitive 
personal data can only be processed under strict conditions, and used for express purpose that it was collected for.

‍

4. data protection principles

‍

Anyone processing personal data, must ensure that data is:

Processed fairly, lawfully and in a transparent manner.
Collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and any further processing is completed for a compatible purpose.
Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the intended purposes.
Accurate and where necessary, kept up to date.
Kept in a form which permits identification for no longer than necessary for the intended purposes.
Processed in line with the individual’s rights and in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, 
including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, 
using appropriate technical or organizational measures.
Not transferred to people or organizations situated in countries without adequate protection and without firstly having
advised the individual.
‍

5. fair and lawful processing

‍

The Data Protection Requirements are not intended to prevent the processing of personal data, but to ensure that it is 
done fairly and without adversely affecting the rights of the individual.

In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we will only process personal data where it is required 
for a lawful purpose. The lawful purposes include (amongst others): whether the individual has given their consent, 
the processing is necessary for performing a contract with the individual, for compliance with a legal obligation, or 
for the legitimate interest of the business. When sensitive personal data is being processed, additional conditions must be met.

log off from their PC when it is left unattended.

Economic Area (‘EEA’) or to an international organization, provided that one of the following conditions applies:

freedoms.
The data subject has given his consent.
The transfer is necessary for one of the reasons set out in the Act, including the performance of a contract between us and the
